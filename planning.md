Todo:
    - larger input tests are throwing errors, need to debug
        - current issue while reading integer values that are decimal values
        - error being thrown via JSONBucket line 294
    - static method that takes JSON input and returns a JSONBucket object contructed from it
    - update error messages to notify user of where in the json the error occurred, not just where in the construction process
